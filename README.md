## Known Issues
Please note the following known issues and compatibility considerations:

   VisionOS 2.0 and below:  

 - If the window is full-sized, the segmented Picker that represents Score|Timeline|Line-Up|Stats tabs in ContentView won't recognize clicks
   made to tabs that are on the right side. You need to resize the window to a smaller size so it recognizes clicks in the right direction. Clicks in the left direction in
   the Picker are always recognized whether the window is fully sized or not.
   
VisionOS versions > 2.0 (1.0, 1.1, 1.2)

 - When switching Immersive spaces on the InteractiveMatchOptionView component, sometimes it won't refresh and call the code inside the current card, and it won't update the
   close button text in cards that display that button.

It's important to provide this information to users so they are aware of any potential issues they may encounter while using the app with VisionOS simulator.
